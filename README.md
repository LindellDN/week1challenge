# week1challenge-
This project is a refactor of the html and CSS style-sheet for an online marketing company called Horiseon.

Improvments include:

-Working and appropriate accessibility standards for search engine optimization.

-Improved html structure that is logical and independent of styling and position.

-Appropriate alt attributes for images on the page.

-Appropriate heading attributes that are in order.

-A concise title that is optimized for search engines.

-Appropriate comments of functions, and comment instructions for adding additional content in the future.
